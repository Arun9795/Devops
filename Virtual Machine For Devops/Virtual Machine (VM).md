What is Virtualization?
Virtualization is the process of creating several virtual systems on a single server. This practice maximizes a physical machineâ€™s capacity by distributing its resources between multiple users and environments.
DevOps teams use virtualization to create virtual machines (VMs), emulations of hardware and software configurations. Each VM has an operating system and acts as an independent computer even though it runs on a portion of the physical device. A virtual machine mimics all components of a computer, including:

1.CPU.
2.RAM.
3.Storage.
4.Networks.

With virtualization, a piece of hardware can host numerous VM configurations simultaneously without performance issues. The main benefits of virtualization are:
1.More computing capabilities with fewer resources.
2.Running multiple independent systems on a single hardware.
3.Consistent environments throughout the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) process.

DevOps teams use a hypervisor to manage virtual machines. A hypervisor, or a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), is a piece of software, firmware, or hardware that creates and runs VMs. The most popular VMMs are:

1.VMWare (ESXi).
2.AWS XEN.
3.Microsoft Hyper V.
4.AntsleOS.
5.Oracle VM Server.
6.POWER Hypervisor.

The hypervisor runs on top of a physical dedicated server or an operating system to emulate the underlying hardware.
Virtualization relies on cloud computing to ensure optimal performance at all times. Cloud allows a VM to scale up or down on-demand and in a matter of minutes to meet resource requirements.

Different Types of Virtualization
There are four primary types of virtualization:

1.Server virtualization.
2.Network virtualization.
3.Desktop virtualization.
4.Operating system virtualization.

1.Server Virtualization
Server virtualization enables a single physical server to perform multiple independent functions. This form of virtualization leads to:
1.Reduced operating costs.
2.Increased server performance.
3.Faster workload capacity.
4.Server virtualization also lowers managing costs and physical server complexity.

2.Network Virtualization
Network virtualization mimics a network in a virtual environment. This virtualization process distributes network functions (directory services, file sharing, IP configurations) among virtual environments.
Network virtualization reduces the number of physical components necessary for setting up multiple separate networks, such as:
1.Switches.
2.Routers.
3.Servers.
4.Cables.
5.Hubs.
Virtual networks also offer better operational capabilities than their physical counterparts and do so at a reduced cost.

3.Desktop Virtualization
Desktop virtualization creates a virtual environment that imitates the settings and applications of a desktop device.
This virtualization form allows an administrator (either a person or a tool) to deploy desktop environments to multiple physical machines. Admins can perform mass configurations, updates, and security checks on all virtual desktops simultaneously.
Virtual desktop infrastructure is ideal for providing a secure, centralized work environment accessible from any device.

4.Operating System Virtualization
Operating system virtualization allows a developer to deploy multiple operating systems on a single machine. This virtualization type helps a team to:
1.Reduce bulk hardware costs.
2.Test an app in multiple operating systems on a single machine.
3.Increase security due to the isolation of virtual instances (e.g., test unapproved software solutions).
4.Speed up IT services.
Operating system virtualization is a popular option when a team needs to run Linux and Windows environments on a single device.
