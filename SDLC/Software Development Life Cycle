Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software. 
SDLC, or software development life cycle, is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step.

Stages of the Software Development Life Cycle:
1. Planning and Requirement Analysis
2.Defining Requirement
3. Designing Architecture
4.Developing Product
5.Product Testing and Integration
6.Deployment and Maintenance of Products

Software Development Life Cycle Models:
1. Waterfall Model
2. Agile Model
3. Spiral Model

Conclusion
In conclusion, we now know that the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in software engineering is an important framework 
for the better and more structured development of optimized software programs. In a world full of rapid evolution in technology, 
SDLC phases plays a crucial role in enabling some good and innovative solutions for helping users and organizations. 
Also, itâ€™s better to adapt SDLC principles to achieve software development goals effectively.
